    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally decided to make the leap and cleanse myself of all Windows
installations. I, like so many others, have long been tethered to Windows by
video games. These days, StarCraft is about the only game I play anymore, and
since it purportedly <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=20882">works great on
Wine</a>, I
decided to give it a shot. There were
<a href="http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2010/07/howto-starcraft-2-on-linux-with-wine.html">some</a>
<a href="http://www.retrohive.com/2013/09/play-starcraft-ii-linux-ubuntu/">other</a>
great blog posts that got me most of the way there, but some of that information
is outdated and gave me problems. I had no need to modify any Wine libraries
or to lower the Windows version with <code>winecfg</code>. With one small hiccup, it worked
perfectly by simply installing Wine, the correct dependencies, and the game.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what worked for me.</p>

<h2>Install Wine and Dependencies</h2>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.winehq.org">Wine</a>:<br>
<code>$ sudo apt-get install wine</code></li>
<li>Install some dependencies for StarCraft with <code>winetricks</code>:<br>
<div class="wrap-code">
 <code>$ winetricks droid fontfix fontsmooth-rgb gdiplus gecko vcrun2008 vcrun2005
               allfonts d3dx11_43 win7 ie6</code>
</div></li>
</ol>

<h2>Install StarCraft</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://dist.blizzard.com/downloads/sc2-installers/full/StarCraft-II-Setup-enUS.exe">the installer</a>
from <a href="https://www.battle.net">Battle.net</a></li>
<li>Run the installer with Wine to install the game</li>
</ol>

<h2>Try It Out and Fix Any Issues</h2>

<p>At this point in my installation, I ran the game to try it out, and I had a
minor problem. The game changed my 1280x720 display to 1920x1080 and caused a
glitch with my mouse pointer. To fix this problem, I ran <code>winecfg</code> and
instructed it to emulate a desktop environment at the correct resolution. Worked
like a charm and also fixes some issues with Alt+Tabbing out of the game.</p>

<p>If you encounter any other issues, check out the blog posts I mentioned
previously for some tips
(<a href="http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2010/07/howto-starcraft-2-on-linux-with-wine.html">here</a>
and <a href="http://www.retrohive.com/2013/09/play-starcraft-ii-linux-ubuntu/">here</a>).
If those don&#39;t help you and Google fails you, head over to
<a href="http://askubuntu.com">AskUbuntu</a> and try to find help there.</p>

<p>With that, I hope you&#39;ve got StarCraft II working on your Linux box! Please
leave a comment if you run into issues. Most importantly...</p>
